# How emotions play a role on cognition in a platform game environment

This application was developed as a product for the final assignment of SS142 - Theories of Cognition and Emotion at Minerva University.

One of the main theories relates that emotion has an important part on cognition. To test this hypothesis, I decided to create the same game with different variables related to a positive, neutral or negative stimuli.

I wanted to understand if a person receiving positive stimuli would have better results when compared to people that got the negative and neutral stimuli.

## Emotion Elicitors

According to to some papers, I have found some variables that I am going to manipulate in order to try to change the emotions of the player.

There are 3 different groups: Positive, Negative, and Neutral.

For each of these groups, there will be different colors, objects, characters, monsters, soundtrack, sound effects, and story that will have some aspects of the type of emotion it is trying to evoke.

All the files used in the game where download for free on websites like [gameart2d](https://www.gameart2d.com/)

## Design

In order to create some game that would have some level of problem solving, I decided to replicate level 2-1 from Super Mario Bros in these different contexts using the free online version of Construct 3.

Mario Bros is a famous game and so platformer games are well difunded. Taking a type of game where most people would be confortable playing and with simple comands removes the bias that some people would need to learn first how to play in order to complete the game and others don't. 

I decided to pick this one as it is a level not so simple, in which people would get bored easily and there wouldn't have much to compare, and not so challenging, in which people would be frustrated for not completing.

## Analysis

For the analysis, I collected a few information about the game while the player is playing such as time duration, coins collected, monsters detroyed, if it was completed, and the type of the game.

After the user dies or wins, I send a POST request to my application and record those information.
